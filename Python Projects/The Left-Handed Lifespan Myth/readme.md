### Project Overview

This project delves into the fascinating relationship between handedness and longevity using statistical analysis and Bayesian methods. The objective is to challenge stereotypes surrounding left-handed individuals and their perceived shorter lifespan. Leveraging age distribution and mortality data, the study meticulously examines changing left-handedness rates over time, offering valuable insights into the intricate interplay of societal norms, birth year, and mortality patterns.


### Data Sources
   The primary datasets used for this project is the "lh_data.csv" and "Death Distribution".csv, containing  information on the age and deaths of individuals based on their gender.


### Tools
    
   - Python - Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   


### Data Cleaning and Preparation 
    
   - Handling null Values
   - Data formatting and transformation
   


### Exploratory Data Analysis
- What is the distribution of handedness (left-handed vs. right-handed) between genders?
- How has the prevalence of left-handedness changed over time?
- When do individuals typically pass away?
- What is the overall probability of an individual being left-handed at the time of death?
- How does handedness influence the probability of death?
- What is the average age at death for left-handed versus right-handed individuals?
- Is there evidence to support the belief that left-handers have shorter lifespans?
- 

### Results and findings 

- In the early stages of life, there are more male left-handed individuals than females, but this difference diminishes with age.
- Left-handedness has increased over time, rising from an average of 5% in the early 1900s to around 13% by the 1980s.
- The majority of individuals pass away between the ages of seventy-five and eighty-five, with eighty being the most common age of death.
- In the study year 1990, the probability of a deceased individual being left-handed was 0.07.
- Right-handed individuals have a higher likelihood of passing away between the ages of seventy-five and eighty-five compared to left-handed individuals.
- Left-handed individuals tend to pass away at an average age of approximately 67.25 years, while right-handed individuals have an average age of around 72.79 years at the time of death.
- While there was a significant age difference of 5.55 years between left-handed and right-handed individuals in 1990, this gap decreased substantially to 2.34 years by 2018, challenging the stereotype of shorter lifespans for left-handers.



### Recommendations 

- Encourage awareness and understanding of handedness diversity to combat stereotypes and misconceptions about left-handed individuals.
- Foster ongoing research into the relationship between handedness and longevity to further understand evolving trends and potential influencing factors.


### Limitations

One limitation of this project is the reliance on historical data and limited sample size, which may not fully capture contemporary trends or account for potential confounding variables influencing handedness and lifespan.


### Conclusion 

The "Left-Handed Lifespan Myth" project successfully challenges stereotypes by employing Bayesian statistics and comprehensive data analysis. While there may be a historical association between left-handedness and shorter lifespans, the analysis suggests that this stereotype is becoming less relevant over time.The findings challenge preconceived notions, offering a more accurate and nuanced perspective on the relationship between handedness and lifespan.
