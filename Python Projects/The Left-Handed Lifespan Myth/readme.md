Project Description: The Left-Handed Lifespan Myth

This project delves into the fascinating relationship between handedness and longevity using statistical analysis and Bayesian methods. The objective is to challenge stereotypes surrounding left-handed individuals and their perceived shorter lifespan. Leveraging age distribution and mortality data, the study meticulously examines changing left-handedness rates over time, offering valuable insights into the intricate interplay of societal norms, birth year, and mortality patterns.

Tasks Performed:

Data Collection and Cleaning: Gathered relevant age distribution and mortality data, ensuring data integrity and reliability for a robust analysis.

Statistical Analysis: Employed statistical analysis techniques to explore the relationship between left-handedness and lifespan, challenging existing myths and assumptions.

Bayesian Methods: Utilized Bayesian methods to enhance the accuracy of the analysis, providing a probabilistic framework for understanding the complex dynamics of handedness and longevity.

Trend Analysis: Examined changing left-handedness rates over time, identifying trends and patterns that contribute to a nuanced understanding of societal shifts and evolving attitudes.

Age-Related Probabilities: Investigated age-related probabilities, shedding light on any potential age gap between left-handed and right-handed individuals and its evolution over the years.

Conclusion:

The "Left-Handed Lifespan Myth" project successfully challenges stereotypes by employing Bayesian statistics and comprehensive data analysis. The results reveal dynamic trends in left-handedness rates and age-related probabilities, dispelling myths and showcasing a diminishing age gap between left-handed and right-handed individuals over time. This project not only contributes to the scientific understanding of handedness and longevity but also emphasizes the importance of considering societal shifts and evolving attitudes when studying human diversity. The findings challenge preconceived notions, offering a more accurate and nuanced perspective on the relationship between handedness and lifespan.
