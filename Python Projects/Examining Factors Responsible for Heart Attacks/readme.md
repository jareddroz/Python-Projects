### Project Overview

The project "Examining Factors Responsible for Heart Attacks," is dedicated to comprehensive data analysis aimed at unveiling insights into the variables influencing heart health. The focus ranges from age-related trends to the impact of cholesterol levels and thalassemia, with the overarching goal of enhancing our understanding of factors contributing to heart attacks.


### Data Sources
   The primary dataset used for this project is the "health_data.xlsx", containing diverse health-related variables, providing valuable insights into factors associated with heart health and potential risk factors for heart attacks.


### Tools
    
   - Python - Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Preprocessing, Model Building
   


### Data Cleaning and Preparation 
    
   - Drop Duplicates rows
   - Handling null Values
   - Data formatting
   - Renaming Columns


### Exploratory Data Analysis
    
- Study the occurrence of CVD across different ages.
- Can we detect heart attack based on anomalies in resting blood pressure of the patient?
- Study the occurrence of CVD of overall patients by gender.
- Describe the relationship between cholesterol levels and occurrence of heart attack.
- What can be concluded about the relationship between peak exercising and occurrence of heart attack?
- Is thalassemia a major cause of CVD?



### Results and findings 

- The age group 55-64 exhibited the highest incidence of heart attacks, followed closely by the 45-54 age group.
- A significant number of heart attacks occurred when resting blood pressure levels ranged between 140 to 165, indicating its potential association with cardiovascular events.
- Male individuals experienced a higher frequency of heart attacks compared to females.
- Heart attacks were most prevalent among individuals with cholesterol levels ranging from 230 to 300.
- Within the category of Thalassemia, the reversible defect type was associated with the highest occurrence of heart attacks.
- Non-anginal chest pain was the most commonly reported symptom preceding heart attacks.
- Heart rate levels between 130 to 160 beats per minute were linked to the highest incidence of heart attacks.
- The predictive model demonstrates strong performance in distinguishing between individuals susceptible to heart attacks and those without such risk factors



### Recommendations 

- Implement targeted awareness campaigns for age groups most susceptible to heart attacks, focusing on those aged 55-64 and 45-54.
- Advocate for regular blood pressure monitoring, especially among individuals with resting blood pressure levels within the 140-165 range, to manage hypertension effectively.
- Develop gender-specific health initiatives to address the higher prevalence of heart attacks among males.
- Promote cholesterol management strategies, emphasizing lifestyle modifications and medical interventions for individuals with readings between 230 and 300.
- Establish thalassemia screening programs and educational campaigns to raise awareness about its association with heart attack risk.
- Educate the public on recognizing symptoms of non-anginal chest pain and the importance of seeking prompt medical attention.
- Encourage heart rate monitoring, particularly for individuals with rates between 130 to 160 beats per minute, and provide guidance on lifestyle changes and medical interventions for heart health maintenance.
- Deploy the predictive model in clinical practice to aid healthcare professionals in accurately identifying individuals at risk of heart attacks



### Limitations

The small size of the dataset may limit the model's generalizability and the depth of insights obtained, underscoring the need for larger and more diverse datasets to enhance the model's predictive accuracy and provide comprehensive insights into heart attack risk factors.



### Conclusion 

The analysis highlights pivotal aspects such as the influence of age, resting blood pressure anomalies, cholesterol levels, and thalassemia on the likelihood of heart attacks. The logistic regression model, through commendable accuracy, stands as a valuable tool for predicting and understanding cardiovascular risks. The project not only contributes to early detection efforts but also enhances our overall understanding of the complex interplay of factors contributing to heart health, offering valuable insights for healthcare professionals and policymakers aiming to mitigate the impact of cardiovascular diseases worldwide.
