### Project Overview

The "Restaurant Revelations" project aims to improve a restaurant website's user experience by using smart automation. The project employs comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to unveil crucial insights into various aspects, including the geographical distribution of restaurants, franchise prevalence, table booking preferences, online delivery services, and factors influencing ratings. The goal is to make the recommendation system more personalized for users.


### Data Sources
   The primary dataset used for this project is the "restaurant-data.xlsx", containing comprehensive information on various aspects of restaurants, including their geographical distribution, franchise prevalence, table booking preferences, online delivery services, and factors influencing ratings.


### Tools
    
   - Python - Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   

### Data Cleaning and Preparation 
    
   - Drop Duplicates rows
   - Handling null Values
   - Data formatting
   - Renaming Columns


### Exploratory Data Analysis
- Explore the geographical distribution of the restaurants, finding out the cities with maximum / minimum number of restaurants.
- Explore how ratings are distributed overall.
- Restaurant franchise is a thriving venture. So, it becomes very important to explore the franchise with most national presence.
- What is the ratio between restaurants that allow table booking vs that do not allow table booking?
- What is the percentage of restaurants providing online delivery?
- Is there a difference in no. of votes for the restaurants that deliver and the restaurant that donâ€™t?
- What are the top 10 cuisines served across cities?
- What is the maximum and minimum no. of cuisines that a restaurant serves?   


### Results and findings 

- The geographical distribution of restaurants reveals that India has tge most number of restaurants where its capital New Delhi has the maximum number of restaurants, while many cities around the world having only 1 restaurant.
- Ratings are distributed across a range of values, with the majority falling between 3 and 3.8.
- The franchise with the most national presence is Cafe Coffee Day.
- Approximately 12.1% of restaurants allow table booking, while the remaining 87.9% do not.
- 25.7% of restaurants provide online delivery services.
- Restaurants that offer online delivery services tend to receive less votes compared to those that do offer.
- The top 10 cuisines served across cities include North Indian, Chinese, Fast Food, Mughai, and Italian.
- The maximum number of cuisines served by a restaurant is 8, while the minimum is 1. 


### Recommendations 

- Enhance the online presence and visibility of restaurants in cities with only one establishment to attract more customers and potentially expand operations in those areas.
- Implement strategies to improve ratings and customer satisfaction to elevate the overall quality of restaurant services and dining experiences.
- Leverage the success of Cafe Coffee Day's national presence to inspire other restaurant franchises to enhance their expansion efforts and reach a wider audience.
- Encourage more restaurants to offer table booking options to cater to customers seeking convenient and hassle-free dining experiences.
- Increase the percentage of restaurants providing online delivery services to meet the growing demand for food delivery and enhance customer convenience.
- Promote the most popular cuisines such as North Indian, Chinese, and Fast Food to attract a wider customer base and capitalize on consumer preferences.


### Limitations

One limitation of this project could be the lack of detailed information on customer preferences and behavior, which could provide deeper insights into factors influencing restaurant choices and satisfaction levels.


### Conclusion 

The "Restaurant Revelations" project successfully delves deeper into the restaurant landscape through extensive data inspection and EDA. The insights gained, ranging from geographical distribution and franchise prevalence to table booking preferences and online delivery services, lay the groundwork for a robust recommendation system. Even though the project focused solely on EDA, it serves as a foundational resource for enhancing user experiences in the restaurant industry. Modeling, the next phase, awaits, building upon these insights for further optimization.
