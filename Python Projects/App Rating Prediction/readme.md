Project Description: App Rating Prediction

The "App Rating Prediction" project endeavors to develop a model capable of predicting app ratings based on diverse app attributes sourced from Google Play Store data. Addressing challenges such as inconsistent data formatting, outlier treatment, and the exploration of relationships between app ratings and factors like price, size, reviews, and content categories, the project employs thorough analysis and linear regression modeling to gain insights into the influential factors affecting app ratings.

Tasks Performed:

Data Cleaning and Formatting - Addressed challenges associated with inconsistent data formatting, ensuring data consistency and reliability for subsequent analysis.

Outlier Treatment - Implemented robust outlier treatment techniques to enhance the model's accuracy and reliability in predicting app ratings.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Conducted a thorough exploratory analysis to understand relationships between app ratings and key attributes such as price, size, reviews, and content categories.

Linear Regression Modeling - Employed linear regression modeling to create a predictive model for app ratings, considering the identified key attributes as predictors.

Insight Generation - Extracted valuable insights into the factors influencing app ratings, shedding light on the importance of specific attributes in determining app performance on the Google Play Store.

Conclusion:

The "App Rating Prediction" project successfully navigates challenges related to data inconsistencies, outlier treatment, and attribute exploration. Despite a moderate R2 score, the linear regression model provides valuable insights into the relationships between app attributes and ratings. The project significantly contributes to the understanding and prediction capabilities for app performance on the Google Play Store, offering a foundation for future improvements and refinements in predicting app ratings based on key attributes. This work serves as a valuable resource for stakeholders in the app development and marketing domain seeking to optimize their strategies for enhanced app performance and user satisfaction.
